### Other

First attempt was in Svelte, using pocket-base to get experience using those technologies,
 but I feel the trade-off of time spent is just so much higher with Laravel.
Also the exciting UI libraries like shadcn-svelte aren't up with tailwindcss v4 (
 although honestly who can blame them, what a nightmare that is).
